A repository of an Agent-Based Model (ABM) that simulates an in-vitro environment for skeletal muscle growth.

Built using Netlogo 6.4

The program allows you to run a simulation of a skeletal muscle culture in real-time, using experimental data that has been reverse engineered to produce mathematical curves dictate certain processes

### Interface of the ABM:

**Legend:**
**Setup:** Instantiates environment with specified conditions
**number-of-myoblasts:** The number of myoblasts you start of with
**temp** Temperature of the culture in degrees celsius (can be changed live)
**O2%-in-culture** Oxygen concentration in the culture (can be changed live)
**Neuronal-media-Conc** Concentration of neuronal media vs skeletal muscle media (skeletal muscle culture = 100 - neuronal media concentration)
**Serum-Conc** Concentration of serum in culture
**Stop-at-1000-ticks** A toggle to stop the culture from running after 1000 ticks.

### Myoblast number with different media concentrations
